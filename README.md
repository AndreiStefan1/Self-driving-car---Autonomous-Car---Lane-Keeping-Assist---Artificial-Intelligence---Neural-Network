# Lane-Assist-System---Autonomous-Car---Artificial-Intelligence---Neural-Network
Implementation of a real Lane Assist system on a project car . The car is using a Raspberry Pi and a dedicated camera to follow any given route . The whole project is based on image processing made possible by using NumPy and OpenCV libraries. 

## Components of the car : 
- Raspberry Pi 4B
- Raspberry camera Pi V1.3
- 5.000 mAh external baterry to power the Raspbery Pi microprocessor 
- L298N DC Motor Driver 
- 4 AAA batteries to power up the engines and L298N DC Motor Driver
- 4x D.C motors ~ 3V-6V 


## The concept 
A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information in layers. Each neuron receives inputs, applies weights, and passes the output through an activation function to the next layer. This layered structure enables neural networks to learn complex patterns and make predictions from data.
In order to successfully implement a Lane-Keeping Assist using Neural Network, we need to divide the process in 3 parts. 

- 1.Data Collection
- 2.Trainning Process
- 3.Implementation
